# Effort-Perception
This repo contains all the files associated with the data analysis on acuity of effort perception. If you would like to talk to me about the data that I have used in this analysis, please contact me at ppadman1@jhmi.edu. 
The experiment contains 3 phases:In each of the phases, participants are asked to exert effort by gripping a handheld dynamometer.
Data is collected at 2000 Hz. 
Maximum voluntary contraction (MVC): Participants are asked to grip the dynamometer as hard as they can for 3 trials in a row (4s  each). 
Association Phase (Assoc): Participants exert varying levels of effort from 10-80u (100u=MVC) for 4s. Visual feedback is provided to help them understand the effort levels accurately. 
Recall Phase (Recall): Participants are asked to exert an unknown amount of effort and rate on a numerical scale (1-100) their perceived effort based on their training in the association phase. 
The end goal is to try and understand the accuracy of recalling the exerted effort.
